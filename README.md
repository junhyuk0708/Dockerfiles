# Dockerfile Backups for Docker Hub Images

This repository contains the Dockerfile backup files for the Docker images hosted on Docker Hub. These Dockerfiles are essential for building and maintaining the Docker images used in our projects.

## Repository Structure

Each directory in this repository corresponds to a specific Docker image hosted on Docker Hub. Inside each directory, you will find the Dockerfile and any additional scripts or files required to build the image.

## Getting Started

To use these Dockerfiles, you must have Docker installed on your machine. For installation instructions, refer to the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Building an Image

To build a Docker image from a Dockerfile, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t your-image-name .
